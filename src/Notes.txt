Tracking the first project!!!!

git ignore ---> create a gitignore file and add the name of the files/folders we want to ignore

    a. touch .gitignore
    b. include the file name in the text file that you have with extension .gitignore
    c. save that file

    and proceed with your regular stuff happily
    your file/folders name in the .gitignore file wont be tracked


    Use git add . to track all files
    the files appearing in gree represents that they are in the staging area


    git commit -m "message" to make a commit in the repo


    To see which files are there in the staging area, we have the command git ls-files
